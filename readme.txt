== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm getting a 404 error =

Please go to Settings > Permalinks and resave your permalink structure.

= Can I add the search bar to my theme template manually? =

Yes, use this php snippet `<?php kbe_search_form(); ?>`

= How can I customise the design? =

You can do some basic presentation adjustments via Knowledgebase > Settings. Beyond this, you can completely customise the design via your theme css. You can use !important attribute to override the plugin css if needed.

= Can I use WP Knowledgebase in my Language? =

Yes, the plugin is internationalized and ready for translation. If you would like to help with a translation please [contact me](http://www.enigmaweb.com.au/contact)

= Can import/export WP Knowledgebase data? =

Yes. You can import/export data using the built in WordPress function via Tools. It may not import any images in use (although it will import the file paths) so you will need to copy across any images from your old site to the new site uploads folder via FTP. If images still appear broken or missing then you might need to run a search and replace tool to correct the image filepaths for your new site.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
